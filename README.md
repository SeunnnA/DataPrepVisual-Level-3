# Data Preparation and Visualization Level 3 

In this challenge, you will build and analyze your own visualizations using data preparation and techniques that transforms raw, multi-dimensional datasets into actionable insights, demonstrating your skills in data cleaning, preprocessing, and advanced visualization development.

## Requirements:

### 1. **Data Acquisition and Exploration**
You will begin by acquiring a complex, multi-dimensional dataset from a public source or by merging multiple datasets. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key characteristics of the data, such as missing values, relationships among features, and potential outliers.  
- Create simple visualizations to illustrate insights and data patterns.
- Include at least one creative visualization that uncovers unique trends or relationships in the dataset.

---

### 2. **Data Preparation**
Next, prepare the dataset by thoroughly cleaning and preprocessing it:
- Handle missing values, normalize or standardize numerical features, encode categorical variables, etc.
- Engineer at least two new features to enrich the dataset and make it more insightful.

---

### 3. **Advanced Visualization Development**
Create a set of advanced visualizations to gain deeper insights into your data. Examples include:
1. Develop a **clustered scatter plot** to analyze groupings or patterns in multi-dimensional data.
2. Create a **3D visualization** to explore relationships among three continuous variables or other features requiring spatial depth.
3. Build a **geospatial visualization** (e.g., a choropleth or heatmap) to analyze location-based insights.
---

### 4. **Insights, Reflection, and Communication**
Summarize your findings in a concise pdf report:
- Highlight key insights gained from your visualizations and explain how they help interpret the dataset.
- Compare two data visualization tools or libraries (e.g., Matplotlib vs. Plotly) to evaluate their pros and cons for this project.
- Discuss limitations of the data and visualizations, propose improvements, and reflect on challenges you encountered during the project.

## Submission

All code must be submitted as a [PR (pull request)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request#creating-the-pull-request) following the PR template that will autogenerate when a PR is made

It may take Learning Ambassadors up to 1-2 weeks to grade your solution and give any feedback/badges associated with this challenge. However, if it takes longer than 2 weeks, please send an email to sparkttl@bu.edu.

## Contributing

See something in the docs that is unclear or think that this level 3 could use any more requirements? Please create a PR that follows the `open-src.md` template and we will get back to you!
