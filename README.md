# Data Preparation and Visualization Level 3 

In this challenge, you will build an app using data preparation and visualization techniques that transforms raw, multi-dimensional datasets into actionable insights, demonstrating your skills in data cleaning, preprocessing, and advanced visualization development.

## Requirements:

### 1. **Data Acquisition and Exploration**
You will begin by acquiring a complex, multi-dimensional dataset from a public source or by merging multiple datasets. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key characteristics of the data, such as missing values, relationships among features, and potential outliers.  
- Create visualizations like scatter matrix plots, histograms, and heatmaps to illustrate insights and data patterns.
- Include at least one creative visualization that uncovers unique trends or relationships in the dataset.

This step ensures you fully understand the data and its potential challenges before moving on to preprocessing.

### 2. **Data Preparation**
Next, prepare the dataset by thoroughly cleaning and preprocessing it:
- Handle missing values using imputation or other appropriate methods.
- Normalize or standardize numerical features for consistency.
- Encode categorical variables using suitable techniques, such as one-hot or label encoding.
- Engineer at least two new features to enrich the dataset and make it more insightful.

Provide before-and-after summaries to demonstrate the impact of your preprocessing work.

### 3. **Advanced Visualization Development**
Create a set of advanced visualizations to gain deeper insights into your data. Examples include:
1. Develop a **clustered scatter plot** to analyze groupings or patterns in multi-dimensional data.
2. Create a **3D visualization** to explore relationships among three continuous variables or other features requiring spatial depth.
3. Build a **geospatial visualization** (e.g., a choropleth or heatmap) to analyze location-based insights.

Each visualization should include clear labels, annotations, and insights that could not be easily extracted from the raw data. 

---

### 4. **Insights, Reflection, and Communication**
Summarize your findings in a concise report:
- Highlight key insights gained from your visualizations and explain how they help interpret the dataset.
- Compare two data visualization tools or libraries (e.g., Matplotlib vs. Plotly) to evaluate their pros and cons for this project.
- Discuss limitations of the data and visualizations, propose improvements, and reflect on challenges you encountered during the project.

## Submission

All code must be submitted as a [PR (pull request)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request#creating-the-pull-request) following the PR template that will autogenerate when a PR is made

It may take Learning Ambassadors up to 1-2 weeks to grade your solution and give any feedback/badges associated with this challenge. However, if it takes longer than 2 weeks, please send an email to sparkttl@bu.edu.
